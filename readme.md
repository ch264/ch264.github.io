My approach:
To make the website I used HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap.
I first wireframed the website and then worked my way from top to bottom through my mapped out sections. Once the skeleton with HTML and CSS was done, I started with the animations with jQuery and bootstrap.

Biggest wins:

Learnings of the following:
- writing pseudocode from the get go greatly increases structe and keeping focus
- check that CDN is included in document.
- when using plugins, check their github pages for up to date information
- learning to read Bootstrap documentation and style my page with it

challenges:
- applying the lightbox to the library with bootstrap lightbox
- using jQuery to animate the nav bar items to the according sections on the page.
- finding a balance with all the script tags and CDNs that can were included

unfinished:
- the nav bar item animation jQuery could be solved better. I would like to write a function to make this part more scalable as now the sections are hard coded into each
if/else statement and I do not like that.
 - I tried to include a parallax effect on the background image: like this: https://mdbootstrap.com/previews/docs/latest/html/parallax/index.html
